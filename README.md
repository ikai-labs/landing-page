TO DO

** Logos section **
- Align with stakeholders which logos can I include
- Adjust size of the logos
- Ensure it is an infinite loop
- Maybe change "Expertise driven" by something that does not include the word "driven"

** Security & Confidentiality **
- Review the required categories (ISO, SOC 2 2, GDPR, ...) and assess what to include exactly
- Align the icons vertically so they are centered with the box on the right
- Review the content of the text with a specialist
- Shading of the title to be reviewed
